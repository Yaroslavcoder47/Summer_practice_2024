<h1>Laboratory works</h1>
<p>This repo containes laboratory works from my summer practice at university. I worked on using JSON files, getting information from them and writing in. For this I used <a href="https://github.com/nlohmann/json">nlohmann::json</a> library.
Also I used "<b>filesystem</b>" library to work with file system on desktop.</p>
